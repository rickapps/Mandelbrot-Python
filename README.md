# Mandelbrot-Python
Practice project for learning Flask, Jupyter Lab

The idea came from reading this article on Medium: [Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set](https://medium.com/swlh/visualizing-the-mandelbrot-set-using-python-50-lines-f6aa5a05cf0f).
The article made me curious so I researched Mandelbrot on [+Plus Magazine](https://plus.maths.org/content). For flask coding I looked at: [Flask Tutorial](https://code-maven.com/hello-world-with-flask-and-python).

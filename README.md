# Mandelbrot-Python
Practice project for learning Flask, Jupyter Lab
1. Convert image png to byte string
2. JqueryUI draggable - out of the box it does not work for touch screens, but there are work arounds
3. Add to app engine on google cloud

A website that displays a mandelbrot set and allows you to continually magnify sections of the plot to see the endless border detail. View website here:
[Mandelbrot Set](https://rickapps.pythonanywhere.com). Although many images are generated by the site, none are written to disk. Instead, images are encoded as byte strings and set to the src property of the img tag. The tool to select portions of the image is implemented using jqueryui draggable.

The idea came from reading this article on Medium: [Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set](https://medium.com/swlh/visualizing-the-mandelbrot-set-using-python-50-lines-f6aa5a05cf0f).
I researched Mandelbrot on [+Plus Magazine](https://plus.maths.org/content).
